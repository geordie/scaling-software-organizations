# Leading with Product or Engineering

Every software led organization has a product management and engineering leadership function. In oversimplified terms, product management is the business function that bridges what customers want to do with what the product does. Engineering is the function that determines how to continuously build, test, and ships the product. As shorthand, Product Management guides WHAT product gets delivered and Engineering steers HOW the product gets delivered. 

In very early stage companies, there are two few people to always have distinct people or teams doing product management and engineering but both functions have to get done, even if by the same people wearing multiple hats. Often early stage CEOs do the product management and early stage technical leaders do the engineering. At scale, product management and engineering become distinct but interdependent teams. They often exist in healthy tension.

Managed well, these business functions are both better off for the other's existence and collaborate to deliver products that are greater than the sum of the teams respective parts. Managed poorly, product and engineering can get in each others way and slow down the business. 

As an example of where product management can inject healthy tension, product managers help engineering teams focus finite resources on effort that has the highest return on investment for customers. As an example of where engineering injects tension, engineering leaders help select, right-size, and implement the best technologies for the product. Each function also usually knows enough about what the other does to provide checks and balances on each other's decisions. For example, product managers help ensure that engineering teams don't over-build, and engineering teams help steer product managers away from product decisions whose payback on effort to deliver is too low to make sense, often because is so much higher than a product manager's intuition might anticipate.

As a consequence of this natural tension between WHAT and HOW, the product and engineering capabilities of a startup's founders, and how founders choose to organize those capabilities, have outsized consequences on the longer term culture and success of the business. 

My opinion is that, at scale in most software businesses, product and engineering should strive for org chart balance. A key characteristic of this balance is that there is one product leader, and one engineering leader who both report into a business leader at the same level of the org chart.  For example, in a 1000 person software company, it's common to have a CEO as the business leader who manages a VP, Product and a VP, Engineering, or CPO, and CTO. Within product and engineering teams themselves, balance can take several forms that I'll elaborate on below.

Startups don't usually start with this balance way, however. In most early stage ventures, product leads engineering or, less often, engineering leads product. Part of every company's scaling journey is to figure out if, when, and how to evolve from the early stage product led model to a more balanced product and engineering model. This is the main subject of this chapter.

## Starting Out
How an organization gets off the ground will be determined by the capabilities and backgrounds of its founders. There are three common cases to consider. The first is when the early leaders have both product and engineering capabilities. Second is when the founding team has business and/or product experience but no past personsal technology or engineering experience. Third is when the team has engineering capability but lacks product experience. We'll discuss each situation in turn and the consequences to the underlying business as the product development organization goes through its critical formation phase. Then we'll discuss how to evolve each of these founding models to a balanced model.

## Founding with Both Product and Engineering
Most startups I've seen start with with multiple founders who in aggregate have both product and engineering capabilities. To succeed, founders at least need an idea, conviction, ability to execute, a bottomless amount of tenacity, and arguably some amount of naivete about how much effort will be required to get traction. Fundamentally, they have to believe that what they want to achieve is possible when most others rational third parties won't. These conditions are most often met when the founding team has a general sense of both what they want to build, and how to build it. And this is most often true when there are founders with both product and engineering know-how.

More specifically, there is usually a business person on a founding team who envisions what customers will want a product to do and how that will lead to a successful business over time after they adopt. And there is usually a technical person. The business and product person or people will most often be responsible for building out the business, the team, amd attracting investment. Over time they deploy any investment to delegate core functions. Often this person is the CEO of the startup. The technology co-founder is responsible for how the product gets built. This will come with an ancilliary responsibility to build a technology team but that will generally be a secondary function to expedite the primary function of building the product as quickly as possible.

In this general model, and because by default we organize companies using a hiererchical reporting structure, prodct and engineering founders tend to settle on org charts where the engineering founder reports the product founder. Of note, this model of organizing the business is distinct from how the business will be owned and governed by shareholders. Technical co-founders often maintain a peer shareholder relationship with business and product founders, even when they agree that it makes sense for engineering to report into the business founder. The assymetry between business execution and business governance can lead to its own seperate set of tensions but that's not something I'll address here.

Focusing on the consequences for running the business, having engineering report into product to get a business going makes a lot of sense. Founders can prove out the viability of a software product more quickly by intially getting the WHAT right, even if the HOW is a little off. In fact, the HOW should probably be a little off to start since getting the technology out of the gate burns scarce resources that are better allocated to getting customers to adopt. There is a proof by contradition way to reason about this too. It's hard to imagine a startup that succeeds building a perfect implementation of the wrong product.

As we'll discuss, the downsides of being product led at founding time don't usually show up until well after customers start adopting.

## Founding with Product Only

Many startups are also founded by one or more business and product leaders who are so convicted about the opportunity that they are willing to get going without a technology co-founder. In terms of org design, this is just a special case of the product and engineering startup case because a business or product leader is at the top of the org chart hierarchy. The only difference is that the founders will hire engineering leaders rather instead of having someone technical as a co-founder. In the abstract, this makes an early technology leader look a lot like a late-binding founder.

There is another sub-case where product and business founders outsource the development of the product they will use to seek traction. This happens sometimes when founders simply can't find the right technology people to hire. Over time though, successful startups usually converge to hiring their own technical team.

Again, through the traction seeking phase of a startup, this works well. After adoption has begun in earnest, hired technical leaders have a harder time raising the profile and authority of engineering because they lack the full governance authority of a true co-founder. We'll cover this in more depth in another chapter.

## Founding with Engineering
Of the startups I've seen, the ones most at risk of not achieving traction are those founded and led solely by engineeing leaders. Customers buy products, not technologies. So the key risk for technology leaders is that they build a technology, not a product. I call this the "build it and they will come trap." What technology leaders tell themselves is that customers will discover and see the value that is indirectly made possible by great technology. They won't.

The good news is that great technologies often have applications in the form of great products. The challenge for technical founders is to realize this early enough to understand that they need to find co-founders or hire the product management capabilties necessary to build a successful business.

## Rebalancing Product and Engineering for Scale
As noted above, for most start ups having the engineering org report into the product org is the default right model to get to adoption. Once a product has traction, and the engineering team needs to scale, the product and engineering team may need to reorganize to ensure that WHAT the product is and HOW it gets built and shipped remain in balance. 

Key to keep in mind through this discussion is the distinction between being product-first and product-led. Arguably, software product companies are always product-first. Being product-first means that delivering the right product for customers with the right functionality and performance characteristics will always be everyone's top priority, whether they are on the engineering team, the product team or any other team in the business. This is different from being product-led. When an product development organzation is product-led, the product team gets to make the final call on what the engineering team works on. The primary determinant of whether a product development organization is product-led the role that both product and engineering roll up to on the org chart. If enginering reports into a product leader, that organization will be more product-led than if engineering and product both report into the CEO or a line of business owner, or than if product reports into engineering via someone like a CTO.

The first signs that a software product development team is too product-led is the product breaks a lot. This can take many forms but the canonical breaking points are bugginess, and low availability. These are signs that the technology and/or team that make the product work are operating beyond implicit scaling limits without enough capacity to adapt to how the system is actually being used. The shorthand that a lot of organizations use to describe these breaking points is technical debt. I'm personally not a huge fan of the term because 'debt' implies that the somewhere on team, people have made conscious and explicit decisions not to invest in technology. That doesn't capture the fact that much of what is referred to as technical debt is driven by entropy and unknowable properties of complex technical system. Software and hardware often break even if no decisions were made to defer investment; the world just happens in unpredictable waya that break things. 

Engineering the technology starts to be levelled up to be scalable enough to deliver long term value for lot of customers.
