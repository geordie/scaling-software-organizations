# Leading with Product or Engineering

Every software led organization has a product management and engineering leadership function. In oversimplified terms, product management is the function in a business that bridges what customers want with the product that delivers those wants. As shorthand, Product Management guides WHAT product the business will deliver. Engineering is the function that builds, tests, and ships the product. As shortand, Engineering steers HOW the product gets delivered. At scale, product and engineering organizations exist in healthy tension. Managed well, these business functions are both better off for the other's existence. Managed poorly, product and engineering get in each others way. As an example of where product management can inject healthy tension, product managemers help engineering teams focus finite resources on effort that has the highest return on investment for customers. As an example of where engineering injects tension, engineering leaders help select, right-size, and implement the best technologies for the product. Each function also usually knows enough about what the other does to provide checks and balances on each other's decisions. For example, product managers help ensure that engineering teams don't over-build, and engineering teams help steer product managers away from product decisions whose payback on effort to deliver is too low to make sense.

As a consequence of this natural tension between WHAT and HOW, the respective product and engineering capabilities of a startup's founders have oversized consequences on the longer term culture of the business. At scale in a software business, and where it makes sense, product and engineering can achieve balance on the org chart, usually by having a business owner like a CEO, lead both functions with leaders of equivalent seniority, say a Chief Product Officer and a Chief Technology Officer. Startups don't start this way, however. In most early stage ventures, product leads engineering or, less often, engineering leads product. 

How an organization gets of the ground will be determined will be determined by the capabilities and background of its founders. There are three cases to consider. The first is when the early leaders have both product and engineering capabilities. Second is when the founding team has business and/or product experience but no obvious technology or engineering leader. Third is when the team has engineering capability but lacks product experience. We'll discuss each situation in turn and the consequences to the underlying business as the product development organization goes through its critical formation phase.

## Founding with Both Product and Engineering

Most startups I've seen start with with multiple founders who in aggregate have both product and engineering capabilities. To succeed, founders need an idea, conviction, ability to execute, a bottomless amount of tenacity, and arguably some amount of naivete about how much effort it will take to succeed. Fundamentally, they have to believe that what they want to achieve is possible when most others rational third parties won't. These conditions are most often met when the founding team has a general sense of both what they want to build, and how build it. And this is most often true when there are founders with both product and engineering know-how.

More specifically, there is usually a business person on a founding team who envisions what customers will want a product to do and how that will lead to a successful business over time after they adopt. And there is usually a technical person. The business and product person or people will most often be responsible for building out the business team, attracting investment. Over time they deploy use investment to delegate core functions. Often this person is the CEO of the startup. The technology co-founder will be responsible for buidling the product. This will come with an ancilliary responsibility to build a technology team but that will generally be a secondary function to expedite the primary function of building the product as quickly as possible.

In this general model, and because by default we organize companies using a hiererchical reporting structure, founders will generally be aligned on an org chart where the engineering founder reports the product founder. Of note, this model of organizing the business is distinct from how the business will be owned and governed. Technical co-founders often maintain a peer shareholder relationship with their business and product founders, even when they agree that it makes sense for engineering to report into the business founder. The assymetry between business execution and governance can lead to its own seperate set of tensions but that's not something I'll address here.

Focusing on the consequences for running the business, having engineering report into product to get a business going makes a lot of sense. Founders can prove out the viability of a software product more quickly by intially getting the WHAT right, even if the HOW is a little off. In fact, the HOW should probably be a little off to start since getting the technology out of the gate burns scarce resources that are better allocated to getting customers to adopt. Since product management should lead to start. There is a proof by contradition way to reason about this too. It's hard to imagine a startup that succeeds building a perfect implementation of the wrong product.

As we'll discuss, the downsides of being product led don't usually show up until a startup achieves enough traction that the technology does need to be secure and available enough to deliver long term value for lot of customers. 

## Founding with Product

Many startups are also founded by one more business and product leaders who are so convicted about the opportunity that they are willing to get going without a technology co-founder. In terms of org design, this is just a special case of the product and engineering startup case because a business or product leader is at the top of the org chart hierarchy. The only difference is that the founders will hire engineering leaders, and likely incent them with a generous amount of equity. In the abstract, this makes that early technology leader look a lot like a late-binding founder.

There is another sub-case where product and business founders outsource the development of the product they will use to seek traction. This happens sometimes when founders simply can't find the right technology people to hire. Over time though, successful startups usually converge to hiring their own technical team.

Again, through the traction seeking phase of a startup, this works well. After adoption has begun in earnest, hired technical leaders have a harder time raising the profile and authority of engineering because they lack the full governance authority of a true co-founder.

## Founding with Engineering
Of the startups I've seen, the ones most at risk of not achieving traction are those founded and led by engineeing leaders. Customers buy products, not technologies. So the key risk for technology leaders is that they build a technology, not a product. I call this the "build it and they will come trap." What technology leaders tell themselves is that a customers will discover and see the indirect value of great technology. They won't.

The good news is that great technologies often have applications in the form of great products. The challenge for technical founders is to realize this early enough to understand that they need to find co-founders or hire the product management capabilties necessary to build a successful business.

## Case Study: From Technology to Product at Metalogix

My Metalogix co-founders and I experienced firsthand how selling technology fail and selling products succeeds. Only through blind luck were we able to back into a great product after a pivot of the initial technology we founded the business around.

We cut our teeth in the crazy days of the dotcom boom and bust. One of my two co-founders, Julien Sellgren, was previously a co-founder of Mindquake Software, a boutique web application consulting firm in Vancouver. He gave me my first job in the technology sector as a developer at Mindquake. During the boom part of the dotcom days, from about 1997 through 2000, we had a continuous stream of contracts to build mostly database driven web applications for over-funded start-ups. One of the cananical problems that these startups had to solve was the aquisition of data from public sources to populate their own databases for their data driven business. To support these requirements, we'd often write web scraping scripts in a language like Perl to aquire data and structure it into the form that the startup required to attempt getting their business off the ground. As examples, we scraped the HTML of public art web sites to support an online art dealer startup and we scraped the public web sites of car makes and models to be used by an online vehicle insurance broker startup. Through one off scripts, we would automate gathering the HTML, programatically give the data structure and meaning and move it into a seperate database to support whatever startup. These startups generally didn't succeed but that's not the point. We saw an opportunity in this repeated requirement to acquire and transform HTML into structured semantic data. In 2001, after a failed pitch of what we considered a great product idea to Mindquake leadership, we left to build own business.

For about six months we built an extension to Internet Explorer, the leading browser at the time, that provided users with a browser based interface to turn HTML into meaningful data. With our tool, users could go to a web site that used a consistent web layout patterns to present data records, identify data elements of interest on an example HTML page, define the domain of web pages that contained similar data records using URL patterns, and pull the data from messy HTML pages into clean XML files. The clean and well-structured XML could then be used by a customer technology team to populate a database for whatever business goal they had for the data. We imagined that customers would beat down our door to make semantic meaning to the infinite amount of messy but consistently structured HTML available in the early days of the world wide web. The techology itself was amazing and required many feats of complex software engineering to build. We felt good about having a competitive moat for our fledgling business given how hard the technology was to build. We'd needed to become experts in Microsoft Visual C++ and the complex COM technology layer that acted as the programming interface to Internet Explorer.

We positioned what we'd built as a business intelligence tool. We managed to get a few lucrative consulting gigs where we used our own tool to fulfill customer requiremetns but exactly zero customers had any interest in paying the tool itself. The reason there was no interest was that it wasn't a product. We'd built a technology that did not solve any well-defined or marketable business problem.

Luckily our third founder, Rasool Rayani, had a strong business background and keen intuition of product management and product market fit. In our defense, none of these business functions, let alone startup playbooks we're well defined at the time. The status quo approach to buidling software products was the waterfall model where you would attempt to define every requirement up front and then go underground for months at a time to build your next version, only to realize after launch that what you shipped was both buggy and failed to incorporate months of new information that would have made your deliverable better. We were making it up as we went along.

Rasool had gone to university with Steve's Cawood. Steve took his first job in the technology sector at a company called NCompass labs that built a successful web content management product that enabled customers to more systematically build and scale large web sites. NCompass was aquired to by Microsoft in 2001 for $36 million. Steve moved to the Redmond area and became a Microsoft employee. As we were building our first technology, Microsoft and the former NCompass team were hard work re-branding and updating the NCompass product which was re-launched as Microsoft Content Management Server in 2002 (MCMS). Steve and Rasool stayed in touch. Rasool would talk about what we were up to at Metalogix and Steve would talk about his journey at Microsoft. Over time they realized that our technology might have applicability as a product.

MCMS had a different product problem. Microsoft's large customer base saw the potential benefit of adopting MCMS but usually they had existing web sites that they wanted to leverage and scale. And there was no good way to move homegrown web sites, or web sites hosted in other content management systems into MCMS. Rasool and Steve realized that Metalogix technology could do this job for Microsoft customers if instead of moving HTML into XML files, we instead integrated our technology with the MCMS API to move HTML into MCMS web pages. To prove this out we cobbled together a proof of concept and a demo. We used our Internet Explorer tool to identify HTML elements that made sense as the components of an MCMS managed web site. Then at the command line, we ran several scripts that used the MCMS API to move those elements into MCMS. And the aha moment was then showing those web pages live and running in a MCMS web site. Steve helped us get a demo with the MCMS leadership team. Julien executed the demo flawlessly, the Microsoft leaders told their team to integrate us into the MCMS sales process where it made sense and all of a sudden we had a product business. Our roadmap for the next six months was to turn the scripts into an integrated Internet Explorer based user experience. The technical difficulty of this was trivial relative to what we'd already built. With a product, defined market, and addressable customer base around our technologh, we instantly got traction.
