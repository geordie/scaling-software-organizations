# Hiring Above

One of the most common inquiries I get from CEOs of rapidly growing startups is how to ensure that the person leading the technology organization can continue to scale their capabilities with the organization. These are interesting conversations because usually the CEO has many good reasons why they want the technology leader to succeed and continue in the role but also see the leader starting to fail. They appreciate what the technology leader has done to that point in the business and feel that they owe the person an ongoing opportunity to grow with the company. They also believe, sometimes incorrectly, that the technology leader has the appetite to continue growing. As well-intentioned as these CEO motivations are in wanting to scale their leader, this conversation often indicates that the best next move for all involved is to immediately engage in a search to find the organization's next technology leader. This does not mean that the existing technology leader needs to be exited from the company. This new leader will likley manager the current leader. When the new search and eventual hire is undertaken with transparency and empathy, the existing tech leader, the new tech leader, the CEO, ane the company can all end up better off. That being said, I see the hiring over process executed poorly more often than I see it executed well.

## Symptoms
Usually my conversations with the CEO on this topic start with the CEO telling me about how much they appreciate the work and deep technical expertise of the current technology leader. They also often express what a vital employee the person is in terms of both deliverables and exemplar of the company culture. Whether the person was a founder or not, the first technology leader of an organzation is also the person most responsible for building the first iteration of technology that drives the company's product. One of the reasons this conversation happens at all is because the technology leader succeeded in shipping a product that got enough traction to enable the company grow. The indvidual technology leader is often the one who has written most of the code, and made most of the decisions about what programming languages, technologies, and tools and to use. They probably also run the software development process. As adoption accelerates, however, that leader has become less happy and more stressed. The source of the stress is usually some combination of workload and discomfort with new responsibilities. 

Between shipping and actual adoption, the volume of work on the technology team's plate grows beyond their capacity to deliver. To adjust, the technology team leader's job has to change from pure technology builder to team builder, process evolver, and technology scaler. This is a pretty different job than creating iteration one of the producvt. Prior to significant product adoption, a small technology team, loosely led by a single leader, can work hard and move quickly with ad hoc communication and processes. To this point, the team will have experienced some internal pressure from their CEO, other leaders, and even themselves to build fast and ship. This weight of this internal pressure, however, pales in comparison to what comes after. Once adoption occurs in earnest, the percentage of development effort that must be applied to systemic tasks like automated testing, continuous delivery, disciplined software development practices, and, security all grow, faster than the team grows.  And as adoption happens, so do new concerns. Now the technology team will also have to invest time in things like customer support, discussions about non-recurring engineering work to support specific sales opportunities, retrofitting scaling bottlenecks in the technology, monitoring and alerting, oncall, and on and on.

Diverting focus to deal with these new and expanded responsibilities reduces the percentage of effort that the technology team can invest in continuing to evolve the product itself. With the product getting real world usage, customers start telling the business what they want more of, and where the product has missed the mark. This accerlates demand on the technology team to build more value generating product capability at exactly the same time as the technology team's ability to meet that demand has diminished. This in turn amplifies the internal pressure put on the team, leaving CEO's and customers wondering why their technology team has slowed down so much since shipping. All of this is overwhelming to any technology leader, even if they've been through a similar adoption curve before. 

If leaders have not been through it before, the rate of required growth in personal capability can be debilitating for a technology leader. Even if the person feels up to growing themselves to meet these new technology related demands. There is yet another major category of new responsibilities related to people management that they must confront as well. At the risk of over-generalizing, the individuals who love building and shipping an early stage technology product are rarely the same individuals who love building and scaling out technology teams. This, I believe, is the fundamental reason why the founding technology person in a startup so so often the first business unit leader to reach their limits. Growing teams and growing technology are different, albeit related, problem domains.




We need to scale the team but the technology leader doesn't want to be a manager and has never done much hiring before.

Our technology leader keeps waiting for me to tell them what to do. I need someone who understands our strategy and will tell me what we need to do with the technology and technology team to execute on the strategy.

I don't have good visibility into what the development team is doing. Me and the product manager keep asking for things, and we're told they're getting done but aren't really seeing anything get delivered.

I am trying to find a mentor for my technology leader to guide them in growing their capabilities to the next level. Ideally the mentor would be someone who has done this all before.

I've decided to re-organize the team. The technology leader is going to become a people manager and their first job in that role will be to hire their replacement and build out the the development team so that we can increase the pace of product delivery.

I've decided to re-organize the team. The technology leader is going to manage a small technology focused team, and I'm going to have product managers manage developers to accelerate the our rate of feature delivery.


From Technology Leaders



Too often I find that CEOs and technology leaders look at building out the team as an unpalatable but necessary cost of doing business; a means to an end to get to the next rev of the product. That logic is inverted. The team is what enables the product to evolve over the long term. Product revenue might help fund the team, but the product itself is not what enables the team. Getting hiring and team building right is distinct from getting the product right.

When this happens, I'm always fascinated by how CEO and technology leader instincts about how to resolve this issue diverge. CEOs and the technology are to hire more developers, get mentorship

** lack of experience or desire to manage people is a particular red flag

## Cause

The root cause of the swamped technology leader is that the business and product is growing at a faster rate than the technology leader and team can scale themselves. The trigger is the awesome product adoption! 

As an coarse rule of thumb for whether or not a technology leader can realistically keep up with product growth rate, I use a simple set of heuristics. First, I assume that a person can scale themselves to whatever maximum scale they've achieved before. The simplest metric to gauge scale is the annual recurring revenue (ARR) of the business associated with the technology team that the leader has run in the past. If the current business's technology or business model is not comparable to the one they led in the past, then a better metric than ARR might be team size. Whatever the metric used, the rule of thumb is that a competent leader can learn fast enough to scale themselves with a business (or team) growing at 25% year over year. Anything more than 25% and they are going to get crushed by scale. As an example, if a technology leader has been responsible for the max technology team size of 32 people that built and operated a product that reached $3.2MM ARR, then I assume they will be good to 40 people and $4.0 MM ARR over the next year. If the team size needed in the next year is 50 people, and the business is expect to grow by 50% from $4.0 MM to $6.0 MM then the expectation that the current technology leader can keep up is unrealistic.
