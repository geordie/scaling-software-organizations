# Hiring Above

One of the most common inquiries I get from CEOs of rapidly growing startups is how to ensure that the person leading the technology organization can continue to scale their capabilities with the organization. These are interesting conversations because usually the CEO has many good reasons why they want the technology leader to succeed and continue in the role but also see the leader starting to fail. They appreciate what the technology leader has done to that point in the business and feel that they owe the person an ongoing opportunity to grow with the company. They also believe, sometimes incorrectly, that the technology leader has the appetite to continue growing. As well-intentioned as these CEO motivations are in wanting to scale their leader, this conversation often indicates that the best next move for all involved is to immediately engage in a search to find the organization's next technology leader. This does not mean that the existing technology leader needs to be exited from the company. Part of the new leaders job will likely be to manage and grow the current leader. When the new search and eventual hire is undertaken with transparency and empathy, the existing tech leader, the new tech leader, the CEO, ane the company can all end up better off. That being said, I see the hiring over process executed poorly more often than I see it executed well.

## Symptoms
Usually my conversations with the CEO on this topic start with the CEO telling me about how much they appreciate the work and deep technical expertise of the current technology leader. They also often express what a vital employee the person is in terms of both deliverables and exemplar of the company culture. Whether the person was a founder or not, the first technology leader of an organzation is also the person most responsible for building the first iteration of technology that drives the company's product. The conversation's motivation in in large part driven by the technology leader's success in shipping a product that got enough traction to enable the company grow. The indvidual technology leader is often the one who has written most of the code, and made most of the decisions about what programming languages, technologies, and tools and to use. The company would not be where it is without the person whose role and future with the company is now in question. They probably also run the software development process. As adoption accelerates, however, that leader has become less happy and more stressed. The source of the stress is usually some combination of workload and discomfort with new responsibilities. In the terse terms of root cause analaysis, the root cause of of the swamped technology leader is that the business and product are growing at a faster rate than the technology leader and team can scale themselves. The trigger is the awesome product adoption.

Between shipping and actual adoption, the volume of work on the technology team's plate grows beyond their capacity to deliver. To adjust, the technology team leader's job has to change from pure technology builder to team builder, process evolver, and technology scaler. This is a pretty different job than creating the first iteration of the product. Prior to significant product adoption, a small technology team, loosely led by a single leader, can work hard and move quickly with ad hoc communication and processes. To this point, the team will have experienced some internal pressure from their CEO, other leaders, and even themselves to build fast and ship. This internal pressure, however, pales in comparison to what comes after. Once adoption occurs in earnest, the percentage of development effort that must be applied to existing tasks like automated testing, continuous delivery, disciplined software development practices, and, security all grow, faster than the team.  And as adoption happens, entirely new responsibilities emerge in areas related to technology, people and customers. Now the technology team will also have to invest time in things like customer support, discussions about non-recurring engineering work to support specific sales opportunities, retrofitting scaling bottlenecks in the technology, monitoring and alerting, oncall, and so on.

Diverting focus to deal with these new and expanded responsibilities reduces the percentage of effort that the technology team can invest in continuing to evolve the product itself. With the product getting real world usage, customers start telling the business what they want more of, and where the product has missed the mark. This accerlates demand on the technology team to build more value generating product capability at exactly the same time as the technology team's ability to meet new demand has diminished. This in turn amplifies the internal pressure put on the team, leaving CEO's and customers wondering why their technology team has slowed down so much since shipping. All of this is overwhelming to any technology leader, even if they've been through a similar adoption curve before.  If leaders have not been through this kind of adoption before, the rate of required personal growth can be debilitating.

Often the most challenging category of new responsibilities is related to people management. At the risk of over-generalizing, the individuals who love building and shipping early stage technology products are rarely the same individuals who love building and scaling out technology teams. This, I believe, is the fundamental reason why the founding technology person in a startup so so often the first business unit leader to reach their limits. Growing teams and growing technology are different, albeit related, problem domains. Put in terms of the distinct roles of individuals contributors and managers, the founding technology leader is more often and individual contributor. To grow, the company needs a technology team people manager. Forcing the in IC technical leader into this role usually won't work.

Too often at this stage of startup growth, I find that CEOs and technology leaders look at building out the team as an unpalatable but necessary cost of doing business; a means to an end to get to the next rev of the product. That logic is inverted. The team is what enables the product to evolve over the long term. Product revenue might help fund the team, but the product itself is not what enables the team. Getting hiring and team building right is distinct from getting the product right. 

## Diagnosis

As a coarse rule of thumb for whether or not a technology leader can realistically keep up with product growth rate, I use a simple set of heuristics. First, I assume that a person can scale themselves to whatever maximum scale they've achieved before. The simplest metric to gauge scale is the annual recurring revenue (ARR) of the business associated with the technology team that the leader has run in the past. If the current business's technology or business model is not comparable to the one they led in the past, then a better metric than ARR might be team size. Whatever the metric used, the rule of thumb is that a competent leader can learn fast enough to scale themselves with a business (or team) growing at 25% year over year. Anything more than 25% and they are going to get crushed by scale. As an example, if a technology leader has been responsible for the max technology team size of 32 people that built and operated a product that reached $3.2MM ARR, then I assume they will be good to 40 people and $4.0 MM ARR over the next year. If the team size needed in the next year is 50 people, and the business is expect to grow by 50% from $4.0 MM to $6.0 MM then the expectation that the current technology leader can keep up is unrealistic.

## Solution

The solution to the overwhelmed technology leader is to hire a new technology leader. To be successful in this endeavour, the existing technology leader needs to be involved. Here are the series of steps I've seen work for organizations of all size that find themselves in this situation.

### Initiate Dialog with the Current Leader
The first step is for the current leader's manager, often the CEO, to sit down for a conversation with the current leader. The main points to communicate from teh perspective of the current leader's manager are that:

1. The current leader has done an amazing job to help get the company this far
2. The company is now growing past what the current leader has experienced before
3. The current leader has continuously demonstrated their ability to grow in their career but asking them to continue growing at the rate of the business is unrealistic. The way I often put this is that the current leader can't be expected to both keep learning how to solve new scaling challenges AND solve the new scaling challenges. Learning and then doing take more time than doing.
4. The company is going to look for a new technology leader and would like the current leader to be involved in the process
5. The company's ideal outcome is for current leader to continue with the company in a new capacity
6. The company would like to hear from the current leader within some short timeframe they are good with the plan,
7. If the current leader is good with the plan, then what role do they see for themselves, and if not, how the company can help them find their next ideal role.

### Align with the Current Leader
Within a week after the first conversation, the current  leader's manager  will have a second conversation in which they:

1. Align with the current leader on whether would like to continue with the company
2. If yes, sketch out a role that works for all parties
3. Whether yes or no, seek to engage the current leader in the hiring process for the new leader

### The Current Leader's New Role
A current leader's transition to a new role reporting to a new technology leader is an excellent time to crystallize the distinction between individual contributor and manager roles at the company. The current leader's new role will need to fall into either the people manager or individual contributor domain. Most often, I see startups get traction with a leader whose long term career goals are best aligned to that of a senior individual contributor.  They may have successfully managed other developers in the early stages of the company but more out necessity than because that responsibility aligned to their personal goals. When this is the case, the new leader will be the people manager for the entire technology team, and the most logical next role for the current leader is as the senior individual contributor on the technology team. Based on experience, this organizational design has a good probability of success because removing the people management responsibilities from the current leaders plate creates the conditions for them to once again grow themselves at the rate required by their scoped down role. Moreover, the current leader and company can continue to get the benefit of the current leader's deep understanding of the technology that underpins the company's product. One risk this model to be avoided at all cost is what I call the "special projects trap." In some cases I've seen organizations mis-apply this pattern by creating a role for the current leader which is more of a new projects or research and development type role. This usually fails for a couple reasons. First, because the role is too isolated from the actual product and business. And second, organizations that face this challenge are rarely of the size where they can afford to adequately fund a proper R&D organization. To maximize the chances of success, the current leader's technology responsibilities must be tightly coupled with the company's main product.

The less frequent case is when the current leader's goals for the long term are to be a people manager on the technology team. In this situation, the logical new role for the current leader is to report to the new leader and be responsible for a part of the product or technology that they are most familiar with and passionate about. A variant of this is when the new leader will be taking on responsibility for more than the engineering team. For example, perhaps the best new leader is a C-suite hire who will also lead capabilities like product management, IT, and design as well as engineering. In this case, the new leader might logically use their proven track record leading engineering to manage the current leader through continuing to lead all of engineering. They will eliminate the need for the new leader to learn how to solve new scaling challenges because the new leader will have seen those challenges before and will be able to guide the current leader through solving them. Whatever the case may be, the key risk with this model is that you are still asking the current leader to grow in the area of people management at a rate that may be unrealistic.

### New Leader Hiring Process
The currently leader's role in the new leader hiring process is also important to get right. Fundamentally, the hiring manager, not the current leader, is the hiring decision maker. All parties must be clear that the current leader's role is to provide input, not to make the decision or veto the hiring manager's decision. One way to drive this is to align with the current leader on the specific things they are being asked to provide input on. Two good areas of focus for the current leader's involvement in the hiring process are technical depth and alignment to company values. Getting either of these wrong will diminish the odds of the new leader's success in role and the current leader will be in as good a position as anyone to provide input on these topics.

### The Role of Titles in Hiring Above
First, title matter to people. Second, titles are hard to get and keep right as startups scale. Calling the founding technology leader the CTO is logical in one sense, because they are the most senior technology person, and it's easier to land customers and get investment and make other hires, not to mention all of the other foundational things startups need to do, if you have someone in that role. In another sense, having a CTO for team of a few developers makes no sense at all because at scale, the role of CTO is a much bigger job.

As with many people practices on software development teams, the solution involves timely transparency. As a startup is just getting off the ground, there would be no point in forewarning all folks with big titles that their titles may change if (1) the company finds tractions, and (2) the leader can't keep up. But when the time is right, after traction occurs and senior folks who are starting to reach their limits, CEOs need to communicat that titles might need to change to keep scaling the company. This brings up issues of constructive dismissal and other employment law but mature startup leaders will usually understand that while their compensation will not change, their roles and titles may need to.

Another solution to this challenge is to leave title room. In this model, company leaders build the team with more junior titles below the C-suite. So for example, instead of hiring a VP, Engineering as the first technology leader at the organization, the CEO or CTO will hire an enginering manager. As long as the team is small, that is effectively the job. Then as the team scales, the person will either grow into more senior leadership positions, like director, and eventually VP, or they won't, and those role can be hired above.

One thing you see a lot of in scaling startups that have recently received investment is senior vice president (SVP) titles. This is because startups rarely assign SVP titles to founders and early employees. Post investment, investors bring scaling experience and a network of operators that startups didn's previously have access to. To help assure growth in their investment, investors will often influence the hiring of exectives by tapping their network. Also, at investment time, there are already folks in C and VP seats. Bringing in SVPs is a way to slot leaders into the org chart above the early employee VPs. Such SVPs don't typically report to an existing CTO if one is already in place in place pre-investment. More often, C-suite technology leaders are moved out of management into individual contributor roles. There are many permutations but it's reasonable in this model for the C-suite who is newly an IC to be a peer of the SVP and with both reporting to the CEO, or even for the CTO to report to the SVP.

For founders, another title nuance that occurs a lot  post-investment characteristic is the dual "\[traditional title\], and Founder" title. Adding Founder, when applicable, is a reasonable longer term way of acknowledging both the big lift that founders need to invest to get companies started, and their current role in organization. And that current role will be bigger, but with a smaller title than the ones they held earlier in the company's history.

## In Practice: My Lived Experience with Hiring Above

I've personally been on all sides of these hiring above scenarios and re-titlings.

When my two co-founders and I started Metalogix, I was one of two more junior founders. Julien, the senior founder was the logical CEO of the company. My co-junior founder had a background in sales and human resources so he maintained VP titles in the sales domain. My title bounced around for the 7 years we evolved what we did to find product market fit. I started as VP, Engineering even though the company was Julien and I writing code in a bedroom, with Rasool developing key partnerships in a bedroom next door. Our first product to get any traction, Migration Manager for Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) worked but needed our personal support for anyone to complete a migration. I ran around North America to customer sites to support their migrations and get them started with the product. During that phase, my title was VP, Professional Services. This title also made sense as we engaged with customers on custom migrations from other content management systems. We'd take contracts and seek to transform the professional services work into new variants of our product. Our second successful product, SharePoint Migration Manager was easier to use and therefore got better adoption without all the hand holding. This enabled us to start hiring. And we also started getting interest from investors. In anticipation of potential investment Rasool and I downgraded our titles to director roles for business development and product management respectively. In retrospect, this was probably not necessary but we did it anyways. In reality, I was more of a hybrid product manager and engineering manager managing a team of five to ten developers while owning a subset of our product suite. In 2008 we sold most of the company to Insight Venture Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners. Post-acquisition, we merged with H&S Software, a Microsoft Exchange archiving product company. They also had a CEO, and VPs. Several other acquisitions followed. This initiated a several years long re-organization of the company as our investors wisely brought in more experienced leaders to continue scaling the company. To their credit, our investors used the model I describe above. We didn't have much choice in the re-org but we were involved in most of the hiring processes and were given the opportunity to provide input on prospective candidates. I ended up reporting to a new SVP of Engineering, and got to work closely with a new SVP of Partnerships, the new CEO while continuing to collaborate with my co-founders. Like most founders, I had to struggle with my own ego at times post-investment, especially when I had differences with some of the new leaders. I also realized, however, that I was learning a lot about scaling companies through the three years post-acquisition that I stayed with Metalogix.

In 2011, I joined Hootsuite, a social media management software company, as employee 40. Hootsuite had already taken some investment from investors who understood the need to scale roles and titles thoughtfully. I was hired as Director, APIs and Integrations, reporting to the first CTO, Simon Stanlake which left room, I realized, for directors and VPs to hired above. Simon was a very early employee but not a founder. Again my role was a kind of hybrid product and engineering management role. Through 2012, we were still small enough that founder and CEO Ryan Holmes lead product management and Simon led engineering. As Hootsuite continued to scale and get traction we realized the need to  delineate product and engineering as distinct business functions. In 2013, I took over leading product management from Ryan, though he continued to stay very involved. At Metalogix, I had led product management for products that generated almost the same amount of revenue as Hootsuite was generating at the time I took on the role, but Hootsuite was growing much faster than Metalogix had, and much more than the 25% rate of growth that I believe is sustainable for capable leaders. While I was able to hire a strong team of product managers, I didn't know how to run a full product management function for a company at Hootsuite scale. Once we started getting into the realm of scale that I had not experienced before, I struggled to keep up. I got some guidance from other seasoned executives that Hootsuite had hired, like CRO Steve Johnson, but as discussed, mentorship alone isn't usually enough scale a leader much beyond the 25% rate. And understandably, Steve and other go-to-market team leaders were frustrated that someone with more product management experience wasn't in that role. None of my peers in the product development organization had experienced the level of scale we were at either. Likewise, we had also reached a technology team scale and growth rate that was past Simon's experience level and reasonable capacity to grow into as well.

Ryan recognized the issue and initiated a search for a new CTO. Initially, this happened unbeknownst to the current product and technology leadership but it's hard to keep secrets in a fast growing startup so we discovered that a search was underway. While there are different schools of thought on how transparent executives should be when hiring above, this experience helped informed my point of view that erring on the side of transparency is better for the business and all humans involved. Once the new CTO search was out in the open the process accelerated. Involving us existing leaders in interviews with prospective candidates drove our buy-in, which increased the probability of both making a great hire and not losing important, if not over-scale employees.

In April 2014, Hootsuite hired Ajai Sehgal. Ajai had a ton of experience well beyond Hootsuite scale at companies like Expedia and Groupon. Ajain immediately identified that Director of Product Management was the wrong role for me but believed that with his guidance, I could scale as VP, Engineering. Ajai and Ryan also identified that we needed a product leader who had operated at current and future Hootsuite scale. By June 2014, two months after Ajai was hired, I was in the VP, Engineering role, and Jimmy Duvall, who like Ajai, had the experience from his time at companies like Magento, was hired as VP, Product. Having these new leaders slowly but surely calmed the turbulent waters for the product and engineering that has previously felt like it was on the verge of drowning. Under Jimmy and Ajai's focused leadership, us existing leaders were able to scale ourselves, our product and technology for the next three years of growth.

By 2017, Hootsuite had gotten to a size that made me feel like I wanted to try leading a team at a smaller organization again. I missed the hustle of Metalogix founding days and the earlier Hootsuite days. In August, 2017, I joined Bench Accounting as SVP, Product and Operations. Bench had investors, and a CTO and VP, Engineering who were themselves reaching their scaling limits. I now had enough experience that I was the person being hired into a more senior role to lead founding technology leaders. Upon arriving, I felt somewhat like my previous post-investment managers at Metalogix and Hootsuite must have felt. There were challenges all over the place that I had seen before and had a good sense of how to start resolving with the help of the existing team and some key new hires. The CTO and VP, Engineering had both been involved in hiring me which enabled us to start building trust with one another right out of the gate. For a year and half at Bench, I helped scale the team and technology by running plays that I had either learned the long hard way through trial and error or learned the easy way from other leaders in previous roles.

In 2019, I decided to accept an offer from Amazon Web Services to lead SQS and SNS as General Manager out of Vancouver. I was hired as a backfill for previous leader with similar experience to mine who had moved on to another opportunity so there were no lessons relevant to the current discussion. I cover some of the many lessons I learned at AWS in other chapters.




----

We need to scale the team but the technology leader doesn't want to be a manager and has never done much hiring before.

Our technology leader keeps waiting for me to tell them what to do. I need someone who understands our strategy and will tell me what we need to do with the technology and technology team to execute on the strategy.

I don't have good visibility into what the development team is doing. Me and the product manager keep asking for things, and we're told they're getting done but aren't really seeing anything get delivered.

I am trying to find a mentor for my technology leader to guide them in growing their capabilities to the next level. Ideally the mentor would be someone who has done this all before.

I've decided to re-organize the team. The technology leader is going to become a people manager and their first job in that role will be to hire their replacement and build out the the development team so that we can increase the pace of product delivery.

I've decided to re-organize the team. The technology leader is going to manage a small technology focused team, and I'm going to have product managers manage developers to accelerate the our rate of feature delivery.


From Technology Leaders





When this happens, I'm always fascinated by how CEO and technology leader instincts about how to resolve this issue diverge. CEOs and the technology are to hire more developers, get mentorship

** lack of experience or desire to manage people is a particular red flag
