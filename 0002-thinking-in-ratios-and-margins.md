As leaders scale and evolve organizations, they must continuously monitor metrics that act as proxies for organization and system health.

Key Ratios

### Manager : IC
Every manager, and manager of managers needs to know whether they have the right amount of management capacity to continue growing and evolving their team and its deliverables. And as people grow, change roles, leave the company, get hired, managers have to anticipate what roles they will need to fill over time. At a macro level, they have to anticipate how their teams might re-organize to better align the HOW of engineering to the WHAT of product management. To these ends, the ratio of managers to individual contributors is a key metric to watch for all managers.

I have managed teams of every size of up to fifteen people, and I've worked with other managers who have managed teams up to twenty-five people. Through these experiences I've developed strong opinions about optimal management ratios for engineering teams. I believe the ideal is for any given manager to lead a team of between six and eight people.

Before explain why I believe this is the right ratio, let's first review at a high level what managers on software development teams do. Managers co-ordinate product delivery, help the individuals on their team get their work done and evolve their career, and communicate with other teams and leaders that are interested in their work. The volume of all of these elements of a mangers job are proportional to the number of people they manage. More people means more hours of work get done, which means there is more to co-ordinate. More people means more obstacles to help unblock for people and more dialog about how to help people grown in their careers, and more people means there is more to share outside of the team about how the work is going.

With fewer than six people on their team, managers risk getting too involved in the details of what
