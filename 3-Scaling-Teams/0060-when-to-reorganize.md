## When to Reorganize
Organizations should expect that periodic team reorganizations will be required to keep delivering customer value. Broadly, there are three types of change that drive re-organization. Each type has a positive and negative form, and different characteristics that determine how difficult the associated re-org will be.

#### Change in the Product Market
As products evolve, and the world changes, how customers derive value from an organization's product offerring also changes. By observing the sum of these changes over time, organizations realize that changes in team structure would enable more efficient delivery of customer value.

The positive form of changes in product market is when customers lead an organization to new opportunities. These opportunities drive proactive change. Our customers want X, so let's organize to deliver X. The negative form of product market change occurs when some external force, like a competitor, partner or regulator does something that an organization has to react to. Our customers no longer choose X, because of external force, so we have to change how we deliver X.

Some examples to illustrate the point. 

One common pattern is for a product organization to learn that the key value proposition of products shifts over time across the mix of product capabilities on offer. As an example, consider a social media management software-as-a-service company that offers publishing, analytics, digital asset mangement, and team co-ordination capabilities. Over time, the value mix that customers derive from this product might shift from something like analytics to team co-ordination as both the product market and product capabilities evolve. Such a company would also need to change their team structure to reflect these changes, perhaps by elevating where team co-ordination capabilities report into the broader org structure, by increasing the relative investment in team co-ordination capabilities or by adding new dedicated customer success resources. Such changes require re-organization.

#### Change in Business Priorities
Organizations also change their business priorities which sometimes requires organization design changes as well. Scaling software product organizations shift priorities between adoption, growth, and profit margin, or when organizations change product strategy. In the first several years of adoption, software organizations optimize for adding new customers. Then they move evolve the product to deliver more value, and therefore more usage and revenue per customer. These business priorities require organizations to operate at low or negative net margins when starting out. After a product is proven, businesses shift to seeking profitability so that they can become sustainable. They move to sustainability by focusing more on optimizing fixed and variable costs as a percentage of revenue. Such optimizations impact how much investment is available to create new value and grow the business. Or, sometimes organizations just believe that product strategy needs to be adjusted. 

Macro-economic conditions also influence how much to invest in growth vs profitability. In the low interest rate environment of the 2010s, companies and shareholders favored growth. All things being equal, those same businesses move towards profitability when debt and equity investment becomes more expensive, or when the broader economy moves into recession. 

These shifts in priority go in both direction. As organizations create new products or deliver existing product capabilities that increase adoption and growth potential, they may choose to move investment back from profitability towards growth. The same investment mix change towards more growth is also attractive when debt and equity investment becomes less expensive.

All of these shifts in business priorities are supportable with changes in how organizations are designed.

Several examples illustrate the point. 

One common pattern is for companies that have achieved traction to decrease the relative amount of investment they make in research and development. Instead they increase relative investment in things like sales, marketing, human resources, and customer support because the payoff for such investments is usually shorter term and therefore shows up on the bottom line sooner than more product development. Logical org design changes to make in response to this change in priority is to stop hiring new software engineers and reorgnize the product development team to deliver new incremental value instead of longer term big bets. And simultaneously, grow the sales and marketing team to create specialization across multiple marketing channels or customers types.

Business priorities also change when strategy changes. An organization might decide to stay focused on growth but recognize that there is a better opportunity in the development and delivery of a different product. This would logically require a reorganization that shifted resources from current products to the envisioned new product.

#### Change in Resources
Another driver of the need to reorganize is when the company finds itself with a suddent new abundance or scarcity of resources. After raising new capital, an organization's leadership will be intentional about what areas of the business to invest in, be it product, sales, marketing or something else. Likewise, mergers and acquisitions leave business with two organizations to rationalize into one. Sometimes spending exceeds revenue by too much and organizations decide to lay off portions of the team to preserve capital. All of these require changes in how the organization is structured. Another special case of resource changes that can necessitate re-organization is the departure or arrival of a key leader. When a CEO leaves, or a VP joins a large org, they will often bring a change in direction, however modest, that requires a re-org.






Because reorgs are necessary from time to time, organizations that foster team culture to anticipate that change or org design will occur are better off than those who engender a believe that org structure is static.
