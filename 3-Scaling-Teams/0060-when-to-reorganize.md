An growing organization should expect they periodically need to reorganize. 

The need to re-organize a team is driven by changes in the organization. Broadly, there are three types of change that drive re-organization.

#### Change in the Product Market
As products evolve, and the world changes, how customers derive value from that product also changes. By observing the sum of these changes over time, organizations realizes that changes in team structure would enable value delivery that better reflects how customers get value.

One common pattern is for a product organization to learn that the key value proposition of product shifts over time from one capability to another. As an example, consider a social media management software-as-a-service company with publishing, analytics, digital asset mangement, and team co-ordination capabilities. Over time, the value mix that customers derive from this product my shift from say analytics to team co-ordination as both the product market and product capabilities evolve. Such a company would also need to change their team structure to reflect these changes, perhaps by elevating where team co-ordination capabilities report into the broader org structure, or by adding new dedicated customer success resources.

#### Change in Business Priorities
Organizations also change their business priorities which sometimes requires organization design changes as well. Scaling software product organizations often shift priorities between adoption, growth, and profit margin.

#### Change in Resources
Mergers and Acquisitions
Lay-offs
Investements
