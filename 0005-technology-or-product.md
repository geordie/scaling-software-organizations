## In Practice: From Technology to Product at Metalogix

My Metalogix co-founders and I experienced firsthand how selling a technology fails and selling a product can succeed. Only through blind luck were we able to back into a great product. We realized early enough that we needed to wrap the technology around which we founded the business in a product that did something useful for customers.

All three of us founders had our first experiences in the technology sector during of the craziest days of the dotcom boom and bust. One of my two co-founders, Julien Sellgren, was previously a co-founder of Mindquake Software, a boutique web application consulting firm in Vancouver. He gave me my first job there. During the boom part of the dotcom days, from about 1997 through 2000, Mindquake had a continuous stream of contracts to build mostly database driven web applications for well-funded start-ups. One of the cananical problems that these startups had solve was the aquisition of data from public sources to populate the databases that drove their businesses. To support these requirements, we'd often write migration scripts in a programming language like Perl to aquire data from the web or some other data source and structure it into the form that the startup required. As examples, we scraped the HTML of public art web sites to support an online art dealer startup, usenet articles about stocks for an online brokerage, and car makes and models to be used by an online vehicle insurance broker startup. Through one off scripts, we would automate gathering the data. These startups generally didn't succeed but that's not the point. We saw an opportunity in this repeated requirement to acquire and transform messy HTML into well-structured semantic data. In 2001, after a failed pitch of what we considered to be a great product idea to Mindquake leadership, we left to build our own business.

For about six months we built an extension to Internet Explorer, the leading web browser at the time. The exension provided users with a interface to turn rendered HTML on web pages into meaningful data. With our tool, users could go to a web site that used a somewhat consistent layout to present data records, identify data elements of interest on example web pages, define the domain of web pages that contained similar data records, and pull the data into clean XML files. The clean and well-structured XML could then be used by a customer technology team to populate a database for whatever business goal they had for the data. We imagined that customers would beat down our door to make semantic meaning to the infinite amount of messy but consistently structured HTML available in the early days of the world wide web. Having no specific use case in mind, we called our product a business intelligence tool. The techology itself was amazing. We felt good about having a competitive moat for our fledgling business given how hard the technology was to build. We'd needed to become experts in Microsoft Visual C++ and the complex COM technology layer that acted as the programming interface to Internet Explorer. Aside from the example documentation on the Microsoft developer site, we knew of know other products that integrated with Internet Explorer this way.

We managed to get a few small consulting gigs where we used our own tool to fulfill customer requirements but exactly zero customers had any interest in buying the tool itself. The reason there was no interest was that it wasn't a product. We'd built a technology that did not solve any well-defined business problem. So we had no way to know who our customer was.

Luckily our third founder, Rasool Rayani, had a strong business background and keen product management intuition. Rasool had gone to university with friend named Steve Cawood. Steve took his first job in the technology sector at a company called NCompass labs that built a successful web content management product. NCompass Resolution, the product, enabled customers to systematically build and scale large web sites using templates and common resources. NCompass was aquired to by Microsoft in 2001 for $36 million. Steve moved to the Redmond, Washington area and became a Microsoft employee. As we were building our first technology, Microsoft and the former NCompass team were hard work re-branding and updating the NCompass product. In 2002, the product was re-launched as Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS). Steve and Rasool had stayed in touch. Rasool kept Steve up to date on what we were up to at Metalogix and Steve talked about his journey at Microsoft with Rasool. Through these conversations, Steve and Rasool realized that our Metalogix technology might have applicability as a product in support of Microsoft's product.

MCMS faced a challenge to adoption. Microsoft's large customer base saw the potential benefit of adopting MCMS but usually they had existing web sites that they wanted to leverage and scale. And there was no good way to move homegrown web sites, or web sites hosted in other content management systems into MCMS. Rasool and Steve realized that Metalogix technology could do this job for Microsoft customers if instead of moving HTML into XML files, we instead integrated our technology with the MCMS API to move HTML into MCMS web pages. To prove this out we cobbled together a proof of concept and a demo. We used our Internet Explorer tool to identify HTML elements that made sense as the components of an MCMS managed web site. Then at the command line, we ran several scripts that used the MCMS API to move those elements into MCMS. And the aha moment was then showing those web pages live and running in a MCMS web site. Steve helped us get a demo with the MCMS leadership team. Julien executed the demo flawlessly, the Microsoft leaders told their team to integrate us into the MCMS sales process where it made sense and all of a sudden we had a product business. Our roadmap for the next six months was to turn the scripts into an integrated Internet Explorer based user experience. The technical difficulty of this was trivial relative to what we'd already built. With a product, defined market, and addressable customer base around our technologh, we instantly got traction.
